# Real-Time Recommendation System for E-Commerce Platform

This project implements a **real-time recommendation system** for an e-commerce platform. The system suggests products to users based on their past interactions with the platform, using collaborative filtering techniques. The primary goal is to recommend products that align with the user's interests, enhancing their shopping experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Recommendations**: Provides personalized product suggestions in real-time based on user interactions.
- **Model Retraining**: Allows for dynamic updates to the recommendation model as new data (user-product interactions) becomes available.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements various evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to assess the model's accuracy.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm for collaborative filtering-based recommendations.
- **Threshold-Based Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, and F1 Score are calculated based on a predefined rating threshold (e.g., ratings above 4 are considered "good").

- **numpy**: For numerical operations and computations.
- **Surprise**: A Python library for building recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering techniques.
- **scikit-learn**: For computing evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- **logging**: For error tracking and real-time updates in the recommendation process.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset used in this project contains the following key columns:
- **UserId**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **ProductId**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Rating**: The rating (ranging from 1 to 5) given by a user to a product.

### Data Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Column Selection**: Only the relevant columns (UserId, ProductId, Rating) are selected for the recommendation system.
2. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) for model evaluation.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: The collaborative filtering model uses the `Surprise` library, which loads the data into a format that the SVD algorithm can process.

## Model Architecture

The recommendation system is built using **Collaborative Filtering** with **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. The system predicts the ratings a user would give to products they haven't yet rated based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar users.

### Model Components:
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: The algorithm learns a latent representation of the data and decomposes the matrix into lower-rank matrices that represent both users and products.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We use several metrics to assess the performance of the model:
  - - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual ratings.
  - - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual ratings.
  - - **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**: These metrics are used for evaluating the quality of recommendations by considering ratings above a certain threshold (e.g., ratings >= 4 are considered "good").

### Training:
- **Training Method**: The model is trained using an SVD algorithm with the training dataset.
- **Training Epochs**: The model undergoes training on the provided user-product interaction data, and predictions are made for the test set.
- **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set using the aforementioned metrics.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the model using the following metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual ratings.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual ratings.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**: These metrics are used for evaluating the quality of recommendations by considering ratings above a certain threshold (e.g., ratings >= 4 are considered "good").

## Challenges
- **Cold-Start Problem**: The system struggles to recommend products to new users with little or no interaction history.
- **Sparse Data**: The data may be sparse with many missing ratings, which can impact the accuracy of the recommendations.
- **Data Variety**: The dataset may have limited product categories or user demographics, leading to challenges in generalization.

## Future Work
- **Cold-Start Solutions**: Implement hybrid recommendation methods that combine content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to address the cold-start problem.
- **Real-Time Model Update**: Continuously update the model with new data as users interact with the platform, improving the recommendations over time.
- **Improve Evaluation**: Implement more granular evaluation metrics like NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) or MAP (Mean Average Precision) to better assess ranking quality.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Explore the use of neural networks for recommendation systems, including matrix factorization techniques and autoencoders.
